WordPress sites may outgrow their build tools due to increased complexity, maintenance overheads, feature development and traffic load. At this point alternative tools for WordPress development, deployment and distribution may be required.

It is important for both developers and content creators of WordPress to be aware of these complexities and to gain this understanding before it is too late.

Docker is tool that could be considered to help streamline and mitigate these issues.

This talk explains what Docker is and why it should be considered as a build and distribution tool for WordPress.

Of course, Docker adds a level of complexity to an existing setup which needs to be justified and this is discussed in depth during the talk.
